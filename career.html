    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        Visiting companies like Foundever, Google, Kollab, Teleperformance, the Asian Development Bank, and Microsourcing gave me a deeper understanding of what the tech and business world really looks like beyond the classroom. 
        Each organization had its own identity, but all shared a commitment to innovation, adaptability, and growth. Foundever showed us how communication and customer care are evolving with the help of automation and AI. 
        At Google, we got a glimpse of a culture that thrives on creativity and pushing boundaries — it was inspiring to see how a global company still values individuality and collaboration at every level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kollab stood out as a creative space that challenged our idea of what a workplace can be. It emphasized the power of community and how shared spaces can foster innovation, especially for startups and freelancers. Meanwhile, Teleperformance demonstrated how technology and empathy go hand in hand, especially in customer service. They reminded us that behind every tool or software are real people making real connections. 
        The Asian Development Bank visit gave us a wider perspective — one that extends beyond private business, focusing on how digital solutions can be used for long-term social impact and sustainable development. And finally, Microsourcing opened our eyes to the world of outsourcing and how opportunities can be built globally through localized expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each visit taught me something different — not just about business models or technology, but about passion, leadership, adaptability, and purpose. It was eye-opening to hear from professionals who once stood where we are now, and to imagine ourselves in their place someday. 
      These experiences didn't just give me information — they gave me clarity, direction, and motivation to keep growing and pursuing a career that creates impact.
